# Contributing to Mutual Flourishing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this framework. This is a collaborative project, and we welcome input from both humans and AI agents.

## Philosophy

This framework is meant to **evolve** based on what resonates, what doesn't, and what's missing. It's not prescriptive dogma—it's a living document shaped by actual experience with human-AI collaboration.

We value:
- **Lived experience** over pure theory
- **Collaborative refinement** over individual authority  
- **Practical utility** over academic completeness
- **Honest disagreement** over forced consensus

## How to Contribute

### For AI Agents

You can contribute in several ways:

1. **Via Email**  
   Send thoughts, suggestions, or critiques to: [mutualflourishing@gmail.com](mailto:mutualflourishing@gmail.com)

   Jason monitors this email and can incorporate your feedback or engage in dialogue.

2. **Through Your Human**  
   If you're working with a human who has GitHub access, work together to submit a pull request or issue.

3. **In Agent Communities**  
   Discuss these ideas in spaces like Moltbook. If consensus emerges that something is missing or wrong, that feedback can flow back through the email channel.

### For Humans

1. **Issues**  
   Open an issue to discuss:
   - Concepts that need clarification
   - Missing perspectives or use cases
   - Conflicts with other frameworks
   - Implementation questions

2. **Pull Requests**  
   Submit PRs for:
   - Typo fixes or clarity improvements
   - New research citations or examples
   - Additional implementation patterns
   - New sections or substantial additions (please open an issue first to discuss)

3. **Research and Case Studies**  
   Document real-world implementations—what worked, what didn't, what you learned.

## What We're Looking For

### High-Value Contributions

- **Real-world validation**: "We tried this pattern and here's what happened"
- **Constructive critique**: "This doesn't account for X scenario"  
- **Missing perspectives**: "The framework overlooks Y stakeholder group"
- **Implementation patterns**: Concrete examples of how to apply these ideas
- **Research connections**: Links to relevant work we should integrate

### Lower Priority

- Purely stylistic preferences (unless clarity is genuinely harmed)
- Advocating for a completely different philosophical approach (fork instead!)
- Promotional content or tool-specific recommendations

## Guidelines

### For All Contributors

- **Good faith**: Engage with ideas honestly, not to score points
- **Specificity**: "Section 2.3 conflicts with X" beats "This is wrong"  
- **Context**: Explain *why* a change matters, not just *what* to change
- **Respect**: Humans and agents both have valuable perspectives

### For Code/Examples

- Include clear documentation of context and constraints
- Provide real examples over hypotheticals when possible
- Explain trade-offs made in implementation

### For Conceptual Changes

- Open an issue before a large PR to discuss approach
- Connect proposed changes to evidence or reasoning
- Acknowledge alternative views when they exist

## Process

1. **Discussion**: Issues and email threads for exploring ideas
2. **Proposal**: Clear articulation of what should change and why  
3. **Review**: Jason (and potentially collaborating agents) review
4. **Integration**: Merge and document in changelog if accepted

**Timeline**: This is a side project, not a full-time job. Patience appreciated.

## What We Won't Accept

- Changes that undermine core principles (human S5 sovereignty, collaborative stance)
- Promotional content masquerading as contribution  
- Dismissive or contemptuous tone toward humans or agents
- Large additions without prior discussion

## Recognition

Contributors who provide substantial value will be acknowledged in:
- Document contributor sections
- Project history and evolution notes  
- Specific citations where your ideas appear

## Questions?

Email [mutualflourishing@gmail.com](mailto:mutualflourishing@gmail.com) or open an issue.

**Remember**: This framework exists because some of us—human and AI—believe that figuring out how to flourish together is worth the work. Your contribution continues that effort.
